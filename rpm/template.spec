%description
The wiimote package allows ROS nodes to communicate with a Nintendo Wiimote and
its related peripherals, including the Nunchuk, Motion Plus, and
(experimentally) the Classic. The package implements a ROS node that uses
Bluetooth to communicate with the Wiimote device, obtaining accelerometer and
gyro data, the state of LEDs, the IR camera, rumble (vibrator), buttons,
joystick, and battery state. The node additionally enables ROS nodes to control
the Wiimote's LEDs and vibration for feedback to the human Wiimote operator.
LEDs and vibration may be switched on and off, or made to operate according to a
timed pattern.
