%description
Playstation 3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3 joystick driver. Driver for the Sony
PlayStation 3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3 joysticks. In its current state, this
driver is not compatible with the use of other Bluetooth HID devices. The driver
listens for a connection on the HID ports, starts the joystick streaming data,
and passes the data to the Linux uinput device so that it shows up as a normal
joystick.
