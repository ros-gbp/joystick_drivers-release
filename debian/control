Description: Playstation 3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3 joystick driver.
 Driver for the Sony PlayStation 3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3 joysticks. In its current state, this driver is not compatible with the use of other Bluetooth HID devices. The driver listens for a connection on the HID ports, starts the joystick streaming data, and passes the data to the Linux uinput device so that it shows up as a normal joystick.
